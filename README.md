# CS 421 Assignment 2 - Bash Scripts for Server Management

To explain different backup schemes and how each is executed, including the 
advantages and disadvantages of each.
1. Full Backup
How it works:
A full backup makes a complete copy of all data, files, and system states.
It stores everything into a backup location at once.
Advantages:
a). Easiest to restore â€” everything is contained in a single backup file.
b). Simple to manage and verify.

2. Incremental Backup
How it works
Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup (either full or incremental).
The first backup is a full backup, followed by incremental backups.
Advantages:
a). Faster and uses less storage after the initial full backup.
b). Efficient for systems with frequent small changes.
c). Minimizes backup time and system load.

3.Differential Backup
How it works:
Backs up all changes made since the last full backup.
Differs from incremental backups by always comparing against the last full backup, not the last backup of any type.
Advantages:
a). Faster restores than incremental backups because only the full backup and the latest differential are needed.
b). Simpler than incremental in terms of management and recovery.
c). Good balance between backup time and storage space.
